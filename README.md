Aaron Sweeney
=============



I have recently graduated from [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), Europeâ€™s leading web development boot camp. There I learned the principles of software craftsmanship and best design practices with a heavy emphasis on Pair Programming and Test Driven Development. In order to succeed at Makers Academy I was required to learn a range of new technologies at a very fast pace. I am passionate about code, particularly front-end technologies and I am excited to start my career as a web developer.
